	* Changed the prototype for kthread_create to except the size of
	the stack to be used by the thread, in pages.
	* Changed the initization code to use a new function to print
	message to the screen, this new function doesn't print out
	grabage.
	* Integreated a patch from Richard Russo <rrusso@cs.ucf.edu> which
	adds better support for printing floating point numbers.
	* Rewrote the flag handling in the kprintf functions to better
	support the ISO C printf flags.
	* Rewrote the thread code to return a thread id to the callers
	instead of a pointer cast to a kuint.
	* Fixed a problem with the translation lookaside buffers not being
	flushed when page table directory was changed.
	* Use irqsave version of the spinlock in the time and memory code
	to stop a deadlock with the interrupt thread.
	* Removed debug messages from the rwlock code.
